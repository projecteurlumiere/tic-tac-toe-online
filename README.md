# Summary
This is a Tic Tac Toe game but online.

I adore this old repository because it is [a beginner's exercise](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-tic-tac-toe) 
which went out of control.
Students making their first steps learning Ruby were supposed to build a simple CLI game and learn some OOP. 
I, however, ended up building a full-fledged Sinatra-based app having never coded web apps before.

## Advantages
- [x] Highest low quiality procedural code
- [x] The classes present in this code are, probably, the first classes I have ever coded
- [x] The game was first designed for CLI, and it still outputs everything to stdout!
- [x] No databases or any ways of communication between instances. 
No one has that many friends to require more than one instance anyway!
- [x] Mesmerizing character visual design
- [x] I'm not sure if 5x5 field works correctly: there's an opportunity for a future DLC!
